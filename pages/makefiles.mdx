# Makefiles

A Makefile is a file, read by the `Make` program, which executes all the commands and rules in the Makefile.

At EPITECH, you'll be using Makefiles to compile your c code, using **gcc**.

Here is an example of a Makefile to the coding style as of 2023:

```make filename="Makefile" copy
##
## EPITECH PROJECT, 2023
## Project Name
## File description:
## Makefile for an epitech project
##

SRC	=	src/main.c\
		src/my_function.c\
		src/my_other_function.c

OBJ	=	$(SRC:.c=.o)

NAME	=	my_binary_name

CFLAGS	=	-Wall -Wextra -I./include

all:	$(NAME)

$(NAME):	$(OBJ)
	gcc -o $(NAME) $(OBJ)

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJ)

fclean:	clean
	rm -f $(NAME)

re:	fclean all

.PHONY:	all clean fclean re
```

You can now compile your code using the following commands:

```bash filename="Recompile entire codebase" copy
make re
```

```bash filename="Only compile new changes" copy
make
```

```bash filename="delete all binary and leftover files" copy
make fclean
```

```bash filename="delete only leftover files (not binary)" copy
make clean
```

  You can also use `make -s` to compile in "silent" mode and only show warnings (if any).

  Making your own `debug`, `tests` and `bonus` rules is recommended to be more productive.
